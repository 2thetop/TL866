Simple low level winelib usb wrapper for Minipro V6.0/V6.10/V6.13/V6.16/V6.17/V6.50/V6.60
This version will autodetect the MiniPro.exe version and it should be compatible with future versions.

Add the following rule to the udev subsystem:
open terminal and as root type:
#echo 'SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="e11c", GROUP="plugdev", MODE="0666"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/51-minipro.rules
#udevadm trigger


How to install:
1. Install wine
2. Copy the provided setupapi.dll file in the minipro folder
3. Run the Minipro.exe


Also be sure to add a rule to the udev subsystem (see above) to permit libusb access to usb interface from an regular user.

How to compile:
1. Install wine, wine-devel, libusb-devel, libudev-devel packages
2. Run make
3. Rename usb.dll.so as setupapi.dll and copy this file in the minipro folder
4. Run the Minipro.exe
